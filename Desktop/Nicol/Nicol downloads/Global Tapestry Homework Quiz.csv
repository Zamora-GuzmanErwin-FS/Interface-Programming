The political institution was not a continuity of previous regimes, since it had to rule people with diverse cultural and social heritage. The Mongol Empire invented a new ideology, which influences China to this day, for unification under the Mongol ruler. The Mongol ruler appeared to inner Asia as Khan (elected by tribal nobles), to south Song as emperor, and to Tibet as patron and protector of Buddhism (called patron-priest relationship by Tibetans). These multiple roles were based on the culture of each region and were not new inventions. However, previously these were incompatible cultures, and the ruler should not be the same person. In particular, Han Chinese used to see themselves as culturally superior to Mongols and should not be ruled by barbarians. The new invention created a new concept of unified China that was greater than any previous regime in China , and was inherited by Qing dynasty, which formed the basis of the territory of contemporary China.

The ruler serving multiple roles for different people was not new in world history. Parthian Empire which was contemporary with Han dynasty already created such institutions. When Deng Xiaoping proposed “one country, two systems”, he may not be aware of such historical precedents.

It should be noted that though the Genealogy books of Chinese often claim ancestry to more than a thousand years, in reality they have individual names only after 1300s.

Lack of seriousness in the intellectual culture caused the downfall of the Tang.

With this, it helped encourage and promote trading among people. Another thing was how a tribute system was made. This was a requirement for trade, as well as annual tributes for neighboring states.

Soon China started to become more innovative. China started to build roads and canals. With these, trading was much easier to do. Next thing was technology being introduced. Inventions like the Champa rice was found. Champa rice was good because of how drought resistant it was. China also started to manufacture steel, and other products to reinforce trading.

The bureaucracy had been used since the Qin dynasty however, it was this government that helped the Song Dynasty maintain its stability, strength, and power. The imperial bureaucracy is an example of the continuity of the empire as it is a form of government that was used unbrokenly throughout the different Dynasties. 

To add on, we can see the Song Dynasty using innovations to create and expand its trades as well as its resources. The first gun was made in the Song Dynasty and the technology of the gun as well as gunpowder spread all over China and Eurasia because of the silk roads. We can also see more innovation when different types of rice that were better suited for dryer climates and ripened faster were massively produced in order to grow rice in areas where it was not possible before. Innovation also changed how agriculture originally worked. China started to use manure to enrich the soil, built irrigation systems to water the crops and overall increase productivity, and used different plows along with animals to help plant crops in tougher soil. The compass also added to the innovation of China, it would be used to better help people mostly sailors, find directions, meaning they wouldn't need to rely on the sky as much. 

Finally, the Song Dynasty had an Civil Service Exam. If a person scored well on the exam they would be able to obtain a job in the bureaucracy. This exam allowed for better educational opportunities for the lower classes. The exam represents diversity, as the empire allowed for a wider spectrum of people in different classes and families to participate. We can see more diversity occur when China's class system was changed.
